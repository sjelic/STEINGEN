  abstract = {This paper considers the integration of three essential seaport terminal operations: the berth allocation problem, the quay crane assignment problem (QCAP), and the quay crane scheduling problem (QCSP). The paper presents a new mathematical formulation that captures all associated operations and constraints. Different quay crane operational policies are considered, namely permitting versus not permitting bay task preemption in QCSP and static versus dynamic crane allocations in QCAP. Thus, variants of the mathematical formulation are introduced to capture the different combinations of these scenarios. Due to the preemption consideration, the models include disaggregated quay crane (QC) tasks. Specifically, QC tasks are identified by single container movements as opposed to bay or stack task allocations that are commonly used in the literature. A case study based on Abu Dhabi’s container terminal is presented where the use of the proposed mathematical models are compared against the current existing operational approach. Results show that the service times can be significantly decreased by the use of the proposed models. Moreover, the policy choice effect on the total schedule is compared through simulated examples and Abu Dhabi’s container terminal case study. The results show that the policy improvements can depend on the problem’s attributes and thus a better policy cannot be generalized.},

The objective is to minimize a tardiness indicator based on the customer delivery deadlines. This article provides a better understanding of how three major tardiness indicators can be used to improve the quality of service by minimizing the maximum tardiness, the total tardiness, or the number of late deliveries. We study the problem complexity, devise a unifying Mixed Integer Programming formulation and propose an efficient branch-and-Benders-cut scheme to deal with instances of realistic size. Numerical results show that this novel Benders approach with a tailored combinatorial algorithm for generating Benders cuts largely outperforms all other alternatives. In our managerial study, we vary the number of available facilities, the coverage radius of autonomous robots and their speed, to assess their impact on the quality of service and environmental costs.},

  abstract = {Operational Research and Optimization are fundamental disciplines which, for decades, provided the real-world with tools for solving practical problems. Many such problems arise in container ports. Container terminals are important assets in modern economies. They constitute an important means of distributing goods made overseas to domestic markets in most countries. They are expensive to build and difficult to operate. We describe here some of the main operations which are faced daily by decision makers at those facilities. Decision makers often use Operational Research and Optimization tools to run these operations effectively. In this thesis, we focus on seaside operations which can be divided into three main problems: 1- the Berth Allocation Problem (BAP), 2- the Quay Crane Assignment Problem (QCAP), 3- the Quay Crane Scheduling Problem (QCSP). Each one of the above is a complex optimization problem in its own right. However, solving them individually without the consideration of the others may lead to overall suboptimal solutions. For this reason we will investigate the pairwise combinations of these problems and their total integration In addition, several important factors that affected on the final solution. The main contributions of this study are modelling and solving of the: 1- Robust berth allocation problem (RBAP): a new efficient mathematical model is formulated and a hybrid algorithm based on Branch-and-Cut and the Genetic Algorithm is used to find optimal or near optimal solutions for large scale instances in reasonable time. 2- Quay crane assignment and quay crane scheduling problem (QCASP): a new mathematical model is built to simultaneously solve QCASP and a heuristic based on the Genetic Algorithm is developed to find solutions to realistic instances in reasonable time. 3- Berth allocation, quay crane assignment and quay crane scheduling problem (BACASP): an aggregate model for all three seaside operations is proposed and to solve realistic instances of the problem, an adapted variant of the Genetic Algorithm is implemented.

  abstract = {The DC programming and its DC algorithm (DCA) address the problem of minimizing a function f=g−h (with g,h being lower semicontinuous proper convex functions on Rn) on the whole space. Based on local optimality conditions and DC duality, DCA was successfully applied to a lot of different and various nondifferentiable nonconvex optimization problems to which it quite often gave global solutions and proved to be more robust and more efficient than related standard methods, especially in the large scale setting. The computational efficiency of DCA suggests to us a deeper and more complete study on DC programming, using the special class of DC programs (when either g or h is polyhedral convex) called polyhedral DC programs. The DC duality is investigated in an easier way, which is more convenient to the study of optimality conditions. New practical results on local optimality are presented. We emphasize regularization techniques in DC programming in order to construct suitable equivalent DC programs to nondifferentiable nonconvex optimization problems and new significant questions which have to be answered. A deeper insight into DCA is introduced which really sheds new light on DCA and could partly explain its efficiency. Finally DC models of real world nonconvex optimization are reported.},

  abstract = {This paper considers a regression-based clustering problem for multiple responses. We propose a nested optimization formulation, where two minimizations are performed one after the other. The first minimization is to determine the number of clusters, and the second is to minimize the L∞-norm of residuals. After fixing the number of clusters, our formulation reduces to a novel Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem, which can handle multiple responses simultaneously. We further propose an empirical approach based on cross-validation to determine a good number of clusters; this approach takes into account prediction accuracies of models when choosing the number of clusters. Using the JURA dataset, we illustrate that the classic approach in the literature, which considers one response at-a-time, usually assigns the same entity to different clusters with respect to different responses; hence, eventually, it is not evident to which cluster that entity belongs to. Also, even though the classic approach assigns that entity to the same cluster with respect to all responses, this assignment can be different than the one obtained when all responses are considered simultaneously; hence, the classic approach can result in a false clustering when multiple responses have to be considered at the same time.},

We chose TransformerEncoder as the base model for knowledge transfer from source to target domain with French and Serbian data, respectively. Even more, the accuracy of the base model with the preprocessing step is improved by 2\% when trained and evaluated on the French dataset. The transfer learning approach with fine-tuning of the pre-trained weights on the French dataset outperformed all other methods in terms of overall accuracy 0.94 and mean class recall 0.907 on the Serbian dataset. Our partially fine-tuned model improved recall of crop types that were poorly classified by the base model. In the case of sugar beet, class recall is improved by 85.71\%.},

Compared to standard GNNs, KCNs make direct use of neighboring observations when generating predictions. KCNs also contain the kriging method as a specific configuration. Empirically, we show that this model outperforms GNNs and kriging in several applications.},

Then we extend it by incorporating the crane scheduling problem as well, which is named BACASP. Although the model for BACAP is very efficient and even large instances up to 60 vessels can be solved to optimality, only small instances for BACASP can be solved optimally. To be able to solve large instances, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for generating an optimal solution of BACASP from an optimal solution of BACAP using a postprocessing algorithm. We also develop a cutting plane algorithm for the case where this condition is not satisfied. This algorithm solves BACAP repeatedly by adding cuts generated from the optimal solutions at each trial until the aforementioned condition holds.},

  abstract = {Low-intensity tillage has become more popular among farmers in the United States and many other regions. However, accurate data on when and where low-intensity tillage methods are being used remain scarce, and this scarcity impedes understanding of the factors affecting the adoption and the agronomic or environmental impacts of these practices. In this study, we used composites of satellite imagery from Landsat 5, 7, and 8, and Sentinel-1 in combination with producer data from about 5900 georeferenced fields to train a random forest classifier and generate annual large-scale maps of tillage intensity from 2005 to 2016. We tested different combinations of hyper-parameters using cross-validation, splitting the training and testing data alternatively by field, year, and state to assess the influence of clustering on validation results and evaluate the generalizability of the classification model. We found that the best model was able to map tillage practices across the entire North Central US region at 30 m-resolution with accuracies spanning between 75\% and 79\%, depending on the validation approach. We also found that although Sentinel-1 provides an independent measure that should be sensitive to surface moisture and roughness, it currently adds relatively little to classification performance beyond what is possible with Landsat. When aggregated to the state level, the satellite estimates of percentage lowand high-intensity tillage agreed well with a USDA survey on tillage practices in 2006 (R2 = 0.55). The satellite data also revealed clear increases in low-intensity tillage area for most counties in the past decade. Overall, the ability to accurately map spatial and temporal patterns in tillage should facilitate further study of this important practice in the United States, as well as other regions with fewer survey-based estimates.},

However, they are sensitive to the choice of starting points and inefficient for solving clustering problems in large data sets. Recently, a new version of the k-means algorithm, the global k-means algorithm has been developed. It is an incremental algorithm that dynamically adds one cluster center at a time and uses each data point as a candidate for the k-th cluster center. Results of numerical experiments show that the global k-means algorithm considerably outperforms the k-means algorithms. In this paper, a new version of the global k-means algorithm is proposed. A starting point for the k-th cluster center in this algorithm is computed by minimizing an auxiliary cluster function. Results of numerical experiments on 14 data sets demonstrate the superiority of the new algorithm, however, it requires more computational time than the global k-means algorithm.},

Most of these systems contain separate components that deal with the acoustic modelling, language modelling and sequence decoding. We investigate a more direct approach in which the HMM is replaced with a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that performs sequence prediction directly at the character level. Alignment between the input features and the desired character sequence is learned automatically by an attention mechanism built into the RNN. For each predicted character, the attention mechanism scans the input sequence and chooses relevant frames. We propose two methods to speed up this operation: limiting the scan to a subset of most promising frames and pooling over time the information contained in neighboring frames, thereby reducing source sequence length. Integrating an n-gram language model into the decoding process yields recognition accuracies similar to other HMM-free RNN-based approaches.},

  abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) plays an important role in the global carbon cycle and soil fertility supply. Rapid and accurate estimation of SOC content could provide critical information for crop production, soil management and soil carbon pool regulation. Many researchers have confirmed the feasibility and great potential of visible and near-infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy in evaluating SOC content rapidly and accurately. Here, to evaluate the feasibility of different spectral bands variable selection methods for SOC prediction, we collected a total of 330 surface soil samples from the cotton field in the Alar Reclamation area in the southern part of Xinjiang, which is located in the arid region of northwest China. Then, we estimated the SOC content using laboratory Vis-NIR spectral. The Particle Swarm optimization (PSO), Competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) and Ant colony optimization (ACO) were adopted to select SOC feature bands. The partial least squares regression (PLSR), random forest (RF) and convolutional neural network (CNN) inversion models were constructed by using full-bands (400–2400 nm) spectra (R) and feature bands, respectively. And we also analyzed the effects of spectral feature band selection methods and modeling methods on the prediction accuracy of SOC. The results indicated that: (1) There are significant differences in the feature bands selected using different methods. The feature bands selected methods substantially reduced the spectral variable dimensionality and model complexity. The models built by the feature bands selected by CARS, PSO and ACO methods showed the different potential of improvement in model accuracy compared with the full-band models. (2) The CNN model had the best performance for predicting SOC. The R2 of the optimal CNN model is 0.90 in the validation, which was improved by 0.05 and 0.04 in comparison with the PLSR and RF model, respectively. (3) The highest prediction accuracy was archived by the CNN model using the feature bands selected by CARS (validation set R2 = 0.90, RMSE = 0.97 g kg−1, RPD = 3.18, RPIQ = 3.11). This study indicated that using the CARS method to select spectral feature bands, combined with the CNN modeling method can well predict SOC content with higher accuracy.},

  abstract = {We present an estimator for the high-dimensional fitting of a linear model with quadratic interactions. As such a model has a very large number of features, its estimation raises many statistical and computational challenges. Thus, its estimation has motivated a lot of work over the last two decades, and remains a challenge in many applications. From a statistical point of view, one of the challenges is to be able to select the features, to facilitate the interpretability of the model. Moreover, since the added interaction features can be highly correlated, an adapted regularization must be able to take them into account. We then propose to adapt the Elastic Net estimator, to take into account the potential correlations thanks to the l2 penalty, and to obtain a parsimonious model using the l1 penalty. Moreover, a common approach used in the literature, to favor main effects while reducing the number of interactions to be considered, is the heredity assumption. This assumption allows the inclusion of an interaction only if and when the associated main effects are selected in the model. Thus, it leads to parsimonious models, easier to interpret, while reducing the number of interactions to be visited and the computational cost. However, it does not allow the exploration of interaction variables whose main effects are not selected, although these variables may be relevant to consider. We therefore propose to emancipate ourselves from this structural heredity assumption, and to penalize interactions more than main effects, in order to favor the latter and interpretability. It is also known that penalized estimators such as Elastic Net bias the coefficients by ag- gressively shrinking them towards zero. A consequence is the selection of additional features to compensate for the loss of amplitude of the penalized coefficients, which affects the calibration of the hyperparameters during cross-validation. A simple solution is then to select the features by the Elastic Net, then to estimate these coefficients by the Least Squares estimator, for each hyperparameter. However, if the features are highly correlated, the Least Squares step may fail. Therefore, we choose to adapt a debiasing method allowing to obtain simultaneously the Elastic Net coefficients and their debiased version. A first challenge of this work is to develop an algorithm that does not require to store the interaction matrix, which could exceed the memory capacity of a computer. To do this, we adapt a coordinate descent algorithm, allowing to build the columns of this matrix on- the-fly. Although this step avoids storage, it adds extra computations to each step of the algorithm, thus increasing its computation time. Moreover, knowing that our estimator is parsimonious, these computations may be all the more useless as many interaction coefficients are zero, and thus unnecessarily updated. A second issue is then to propose an algorithm that remains computationally efficient, despite the large number of interactions to consider and this computational overhead. Therefore, to exploit the parsimony of the estimator and to reduce the number of interaction coefficients to be updated, we adapt an active set algorithm. Second, we adapt the Anderson acceleration, which allows us to speed up the coordinate descent algorithms for solving LASSO type problems. Finally, the performance of our estimator is illustrated on simulated and real data, and compared with state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract = {The vehicle routing problem with time windows and lunch break (VRPTW-LB) is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem that belongs to the vehicle routing problem family. In the VRPTW-LB, each vehicle must serve assigned customers within their availability periods and take a mandatory break within its time slot for a given duration. This paper proposes a new mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation for the VRPTW-LB. The new MILP formulation is based on the idea of the intersection of two intervals, which must be non-empty. It provides a flexible schedule for lunch breaks by defining the earliest and latest start times at which each break can be taken, instead of defining its exact start time. A comparative study of MILP formulations from the literature and the proposed one is performed, which are tested on benchmark instances from the literature. These MILP formulations are powerless to solve large-scale instances. To overcome this limitation, an efficient lunch break scheduling algorithm is proposed and embedded into a simulated annealing (SA) based heuristic. Computational results highlight the competitiveness of the new MILP formulation with respect to other MILP formulations and the efficiency of the proposed heuristic in obtaining high-quality solutions in short CPU running times.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses Multi-objective Vehicle Routing Problem with Multiple Prioritized Time Windows (VRPMPTW) in which the distributer proposes a set of all non-overlapping time windows with equal or different lengths and the customers prioritize these delivery time windows. VRPMPTW aims to find a set of routes of minimal total traveling cost and maximal customer satisfaction (with regard to the prioritized time windows), starting and ending at the depot, in such a way that each customer is visited by one vehicle given the capacity of the vehicle to satisfy a specific demand. This problem is inspired from a real life application. The contribution of this paper lies in its addressing the VRPMPTW from a problem definition, modeling and methodological point of view. We developed a mathematical model for this problem. This model can simply be used for a wide range of applications where the customers have multiple flexible time windows and violation of time windows may drop the satisfaction levels of customers and lead to profit loss in the long term. A Cooperative Coevolutionary Multi-objective Quantum-Genetic Algorithm (CCMQGA) is also proposed to solve this problem. A new local search is designed and used in CCMQGA to reach an appropriate pareto front. Finally, the proposed approach is employed in a real case study and the results of the proposed CCMQGA are compared with the current solution obtained from managerial experience, the results of NSGA-II and the multi-objective quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm.},

Next, we investigate the effect of three state-of-the-art mathematical formulations on the proposed matheuristic convergence. The formulations are implemented and tested with and without the use of valid inequalities. In addition, by suggesting different techniques to generate a feasible starting solution for our matheuristic, we assess the contribution of an initial solution to the matheuristic’s overall performance. We conduct extensive computational experiments on benchmark data instances for the PRP. The results show that a proper choice of an embedded mathematical formulation depends on the data instances’ features, such as the number of customers and the length of the planning horizon.

A bound on this estimate reveals the amount of fitting “saved” by the hierarchy constraint. We distinguish between parameter sparsity—the number of nonzero coefficients—and practical sparsity—the number of raw variables one must measure to make a new prediction. Hierarchy focuses on the latter, which is more closely tied to important data collection concerns such as cost, time and effort.

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \&amp; R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

Instead of using the clas- sical homogeneity or separation criterion, clusterwise regression is based upon the accuracy of a linear regression model associated to each cluster.

In this paper, we propose the use of the Variable Neighborhood Search metaheuristic (VNS) to improve the quality of the solution. Two perturbation strategies are described and one of them yields a substantial improvement if compared to multistart (the error is reduced by a factor of more than 1.5 on average for the 10 clusters problem).

A data set that includes 7407 records of apartment transactions referring to real estate sales from 2008–2013 in the city of Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia, was used in order to test and compare the predictive performances of both models. Apparent challenges faced during modelling included (1) the non-linear nature of the prediction assignment task; (2) input data being based on transactions occurring over a period of great price changes in Ljubljana whereby a 28\% decline was noted in six consecutive testing years; and (3) the complex urban form of the case study area. Available explanatory variables, organised as a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) ready dataset, including the structural and age characteristics of the apartments as well as environmental and neighbourhood information were considered in the modelling procedure. All performance measures (R2 values, sales ratios, mean average percentage error (MAPE), coefficient of dispersion (COD)) revealed significantly better results for predictions obtained by the random forest method, which confirms the prospective of this machine learning technique on apartment price prediction.},

  abstract = {In spatial statistics, a common objective is to predict values of a spatial process at unobserved locations by exploiting spatial dependence. Kriging provides the best linear unbiased predictor using covariance functions and is often associated with Gaussian processes. However, when considering non-linear prediction for non-Gaussian and categorical data, the Kriging prediction is no longer optimal, and the associated variance is often overly optimistic. Although deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely used for general classification and prediction, they have not been studied thoroughly for data with spatial dependence. In this work, we propose a novel DNN structure for spatial prediction, where the spatial dependence is captured by adding an embedding layer of spatial coordinates with basis functions. We show in theory and simulation studies that the proposed DeepKriging method has a direct link to Kriging in the Gaussian case, and it has multiple advantages over Kriging for non-Gaussian and non-stationary data, i.e., it provides non-linear predictions and thus has smaller approximation errors, it does not require operations on covariance matrices and thus is scalable for large datasets, and with sufficiently many hidden neurons, it provides the optimal prediction in terms of model capacity. We further explore the possibility of quantifying prediction uncertainties based on density prediction without assuming any data distribution. Finally, we apply the method to predicting PM2.5 concentrations across the continental United States.},

Many approaches have been proposed, but despite numerous publications, there remains a severe lack of standardization for the evaluation of proposed search techniques. Lack of standardization has resulted in contradictory results from different evaluations, and the numerous discrepancies muddle what advantages are proffered by different approaches. In this paper, we present the most extensive empirical performance evaluation of relational keyword search techniques to appear to date in the literature. Our results indicate that many existing search techniques do not provide acceptable performance for realistic retrieval tasks. In particular, memory consumption precludes many search techniques from scaling beyond small data sets with tens of thousands of vertices. We also explore the relationship between execution time and factors varied in previous evaluations; our analysis indicates that most of these factors have relatively little impact on performance. In summary, our work confirms previous claims regarding the unacceptable performance of these search techniques and underscores the need for standardization in evaluations–standardization exemplified by the IR community.},

In EngevallS: StrLBN: 98 the computational results refer to complete graphs up to one hundred vertices. In this paper, we present a branch-and-bound algorithm based on this formulation. Its performance on the instances from the literature confirms the effectiveness of the approach. The experimentation on a newly generated set of benchmark problems, more similar to the real-world applications, shows that the approach is still valid, provided that suitable refinements on the bounding procedures and a preprocessing phase are introduced. The algorithm solves to optimality all of the considered instances up to one thousand vertices, with the exception of 11 hard instances, derived from the literature of a similar problem, the Prize Collecting Steiner Tree Problem.},

  abstract = {Since machine and deep learning have made accurate solutions possible, the search for explainable predictors has begun. Decision trees are competitive in tasks that require transparency, but have been underestimated due to their insufficient prediction performance, often caused by generalization issues. It is especially noticeable in the case of model trees, designed to solve regression tasks. Evolutionary tree induction can to some extent counteract this over and under-fitting problem with its global approach. In this paper, we examine whether integrating the lasso estimator in the tree induction process, can help to control the interpretability of the decision tree and/or improve its overall performance. We propose a new evolutionary model tree inducer called Global Lasso Tree. Its novelty lies in regularization of linear models coefficients, in the leaves during the evolutionary search. To reduce the tree's tendency to misfit, a weighted fitness function is used to dynamically balance the trade-off between conflicting objectives which is the tree error and overall complexity. The proposed method was validated on 26 publicly available regression data sets. The empirical study showed that by using the lasso-based regularization technique, we were able to steer the tree's interpretability and thus generate simpler and significantly more accurate trees.},

  abstract = {In the \textbackslash emph\{budgeted rooted node-weighted Steiner tree\} problem, we are given a graph \$G\$ with \$n\$ nodes, a predefined node \$r\$, two weights associated to each node modelling costs and prizes. The aim is to find a tree in \$G\$ rooted at \$r\$ such that the total cost of its nodes is at most a given budget \$B\$ and the total prize is maximized. In the \textbackslash emph\{quota rooted node-weighted Steiner tree\} problem, we are given a real-valued quota \$Q\$, instead of the budget, and we aim at minimizing the cost of a tree rooted at \$r\$ whose overall prize is at least \$Q\$. For the case of directed graphs with additive prize function, we develop a technique resorting on a standard flow-based linear programming relaxation to compute a tree with good trade-off between prize and cost, which allows us to provide very simple polynomial time approximation algorithms for both the budgeted and the quota problems. For the \textbackslash emph\{budgeted\} problem, our algorithm achieves a bicriteria \$(1+\textbackslash epsilon, O(\textbackslash frac\{1\}\{\textbackslash epsilon\textasciicircum 2\}n\textasciicircum\{2/3\}\textbackslash ln\{n\}))\$-approximation, for any \$\textbackslash epsilon \textbackslash in (0, 1]\$. For the \textbackslash emph\{quota\} problem, our algorithm guarantees a bicriteria approximation factor of \$(2, O(n\textasciicircum\{2/3\}\textbackslash ln\{n\}))\$. Next, by using the flow-based LP, we provide a surprisingly simple polynomial time \$O((1+\textbackslash epsilon)\textbackslash sqrt\{n\} \textbackslash ln \{n\})\$-approximation algorithm for the node-weighted version of the directed Steiner tree problem, for any \$\textbackslash epsilon{$>$}0\$. For the case of undirected graphs with monotone submodular prize functions over subsets of nodes, we provide a polynomial time \$O(\textbackslash frac\{1\}\{\textbackslash epsilon\textasciicircum 3\}\textbackslash sqrt\{n\}\textbackslash log\{n\})\$-approximation algorithm for the budgeted problem that violates the budget constraint by a factor of at most \$1+\textbackslash epsilon\$, for any \$\textbackslash epsilon \textbackslash in (0, 1]\$. Our technique allows us to provide a good approximation also for the quota problem.},

This approach can lead to data over-fitting, and it is not able to distinguish linear relationships in groups of observations well separated in the space of explanatory variables. This paper presents a Weighted Clusterwise Linear Regression method to obtain homogeneous clusters of observations while maintaining a proper fitting for the response variable, by the minimization of an optimization criterion that combines a k-means-like criterion (based on an adaptive quadratic form dissimilarity) in x-space and the criterion of minimum squared residuals of Regression Analysis. The adaptive metric allows automatic weighing or take into account the correlation between explanatory variables under multiple constraints types. We explore six constraints types.

As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7\% (4.6\% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

  abstract = {In clusterwise regression analysis, the goal is to predict a response variable based on a set of explanatory variables, each with cluster-specific effects. Nowadays, the number of candidates is typically large: whereas some of these variables might be useful, some others might contribute very little to the prediction. A well known method to perform variable selection is the LASSO, with calibration done by minimizing the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). However, current LASSO-penalized estimators have several disadvantages: only certain types of penalties are considered; the computations might involve approximate schemes and can be very time consuming, with overly complex tuning of the penalty term. This is usually due to the possibly large number of times the estimator must be evaluated for each plausible value of the tuning parameter(s). To ease such computation, we introduce an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm with closed-form updates working with a very general version of the LASSO penalty. Such an EM is based on an iterative scheme where the component specific LASSO regression coefficients are computed according to a coordinate descent update. Least Angle Regression is then used to perform covariate selection by evaluating the estimator only once. The advantages of our proposal, in terms of computation time reduction and accuracy of model estimation and selection, are shown by means of a simulation study and illustrated with a real data application.},

Our solution can handle graphs with a large number of nodes.

Typically we have available a large collection of possible covariates from which we hope to select a parsimonious set for the efficient prediction of a response variable. Least Angle Regression (LARS), a new model selection algorithm, is a useful and less greedy version of traditional forward selection methods. Three main properties are derived: (1) A simple modification of the LARS algorithm implements the Lasso, an attractive version of ordinary least squares that constrains the sum of the absolute regression coefficients; the LARS modification calculates all possible Lasso estimates for a given problem, using an order of magnitude less computer time than previous methods. (2) A different LARS modification efficiently implements Forward Stagewise linear regression, another promising new model selection method; this connection explains the similar numerical results previously observed for the Lasso and Stagewise, and helps us understand the properties of both methods, which are seen as constrained versions of the simpler LARS algorithm. (3) A simple approximation for the degrees of freedom of a LARS estimate is available, from which we derive a Cp estimate of prediction error; this allows a principled choice among the range of possible LARS estimates. LARS and its variants are computationally efficient: the paper describes a publicly available algorithm that requires only the same order of magnitude of computational effort as ordinary least squares applied to the full set of covariates.},

It is considered to encompass all of the managerial, physical, geographical, and informational considerations as well as the theoretic disciplines impacting this ever emerging-field. Over its lifespan the VRP literature has become quite disjointed and disparate. Keeping track of its development has become difficult because its subject matter transcends several academic disciplines and professions that range from algorithm design to traffic management. Consequently, this paper defines VRP’s domain in its entirety, accomplishes an all-encompassing taxonomy for the VRP literature, and delineates all of VRP’s facets in a parsimonious and discriminating manner. Sample articles chosen for their disparity are classified to illustrate the descriptive power and parsimony of the taxonomy. Moreover, all previously published VRP taxonomies are shown to be relatively myopic; that is, they are subsumed by what is herein presented. Because the VRP literature encompasses esoteric and highly theoretical articles at one extremum and descriptions of actual applications at the other, the article sampling includes the entire range of the VRP literature.},

Due to the temporal structure of the input data, standard machine learning algorithms are usually not well suited to work on raw time series.

Many approaches have been investigated, ranging from deriving new metrics to developing bag-of-words models to imaging time series to artificial neural networks. In this review, we present in detail the major contributions made to this field and mention their most prominent extensions. We dedicate a section to each category of algorithms, with an intuitive introduction on the general approach, detailed theoretical descriptions and explicit illustrations of the major contributions, and mentions of their most prominent extensions. At last, we dedicate a section to publicly available resources, namely data sets and open-source software, for time series classification. A particular emphasis is made on enumerating the availability of the mentioned algorithms in the most popular libraries. The combination of theoretical and practical contents provided in this review will help the readers to easily get started on their own work on time series classification, whether it be theoretical or practical.},

  abstract = {Classical machine learning assumes that the training and test sets come from the same distributions. Therefore, a model learned from the labeled training data is expected to perform well on the test data. However, this assumption may not always hold in real-world applications where the training and the test data fall from different distributions, due to many factors, e.g., collecting the training and test sets from different sources or having an outdated training set due to the change of data over time. In this case, there would be a discrepancy across domain distributions, and naively applying the trained model on the new dataset may cause degradation in the performance. Domain adaptation is a subfield within machine learning that aims to cope with these types of problems by aligning the disparity between domains such that the trained model can be generalized into the domain of interest. This paper focuses on unsupervised domain adaptation, where the labels are only available in the source domain. It addresses the categorization of domain adaptation from different viewpoints. Besides, it presents some successful shallow and deep domain adaptation approaches that aim to deal with domain adaptation problems.},

It can be applied to a variety of different data types, such as gene expression, protein levels, operons or phylogenetic profiles. In this article, we investigate different approaches to extract relevant pathways from metabolic networks. Although these approaches have been adapted to metabolic networks, they are generic enough to be adjusted to other biological networks as well.Results: We comparatively evaluated seven sub-network extraction approaches on 71 known metabolic pathways from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and a metabolic network obtained from MetaCyc. The best performing approach is a novel hybrid strategy, which combines a random walk-based reduction of the graph with a shortest paths-based algorithm, and which recovers the reference pathways with an accuracy of ∼77\%.Availability: Most of the presented algorithms are available as part of the network analysis tool set (NeAT).

  abstract = {Time Series Classification (TSC) is an important and challenging problem in data mining. With the increase of time series data availability, hundreds of TSC algorithms have been proposed. Among these methods, only a few have considered Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to perform this task. This is surprising as deep learning has seen very successful applications in the last years. DNNs have indeed revolutionized the field of computer vision especially with the advent of novel deeper architectures such as Residual and Convolutional Neural Networks. Apart from images, sequential data such as text and audio can also be processed with DNNs to reach state-of-the-art performance for document classification and speech recognition. In this article, we study the current state-of-the-art performance of deep learning algorithms for TSC by presenting an empirical study of the most recent DNN architectures for TSC. We give an overview of the most successful deep learning applications in various time series domains under a unified taxonomy of DNNs for TSC. We also provide an open source deep learning framework to the TSC community where we implemented each of the compared approaches and evaluated them on a univariate TSC benchmark (the UCR/UEA archive) and 12 multivariate time series datasets. By training 8,730 deep learning models on 97 time series datasets, we propose the most exhaustive study of DNNs for TSC to date.},

The kernel in KENReg is not required to be a Mercer kernel since it learns from a kernelized dictionary in the coefficient space. Feng, Yang, Zhao, Lv, and Suykens 2014 showed that KENReg has some nice properties including stability, sparseness, and generalization. In this letter, we continue our study on KENReg by conducting a refined learning theory analysis. This letter makes the following three main contributions. First, we present refined error analysis on the generalization performance of KENReg. The main difficulty of analyzing the generalization error of KENReg lies in characterizing the population version of its empirical target function. We overcome this by introducing a weighted Banach space associated with the elastic net regularization. We are then able to conduct elaborated learning theory analysis and obtain fast convergence rates under proper complexity and regularity assumptions. Second, we study the sparse recovery problem in KENReg with fixed design and show that the kernelization may improve the sparse recovery ability compared to the classical elastic net regularization. Finally, we discuss the interplay among different properties of KENReg that include sparseness, stability, and generalization. We show that the stability of KENReg leads to generalization, and its sparseness confidence can be derived from generalization. Moreover, KENReg is stable and can be simultaneously sparse, which makes it attractive theoretically and practically.},

We show that the multiplicative weight-update Littlestone–Warmuth rule can be adapted to this model, yielding bounds that are slightly weaker in some cases, but applicable to a considerably more general class of learning problems. We show how the resulting learning algorithm can be applied to a variety of problems, including gambling, multiple-outcome prediction, repeated games, and prediction of points in Rn. In the second part of the paper we apply the multiplicative weight-update technique to derive a new boosting algorithm. This boosting algorithm does not require any prior knowledge about the performance of the weak learning algorithm. We also study generalizations of the new boosting algorithm to the problem of learning functions whose range, rather than being binary, is an arbitrary finite set or a bounded segment of the real line.},

CLR aims to find the partition of the data into \$k\$ clusters, such that linear regressions fitted to each of the clusters minimize overall mean squared error on the whole data. The main obstacle preventing to use found regression models for prediction on the unseen test points is the absence of a reasonable way to obtain CLR cluster labels when the values of target variable are unknown. In this paper we propose two novel approaches on how to solve this problem. The first approach, predictive CLR builds a separate classification model to predict test CLR labels. The second approach, constrained CLR utilizes a set of user-specified constraints that enforce certain points to go to the same clusters. Assuming the constraint values are known for the test points, they can be directly used to assign CLR labels. We evaluate these two approaches on three UCI ML datasets as well as on a large corpus of health insurance claims. We show that both of the proposed algorithms significantly improve over the known CLR-based regression methods. Moreover, predictive CLR consistently outperforms linear regression and random forest, and shows comparable performance to support vector regression on UCI ML datasets. The constrained CLR approach achieves the best performance on the health insurance dataset, while enjoying only \$\textbackslash approx 20\$ times increased computational time over linear regression.},

  abstract = {Comparison of in situ mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIRS) with laboratory MIRS is required to demonstrate the accuracy of field-scale prediction of soil properties. Application of MIRS to investigate soil management questions must also be tested. Our objectives were therefore to determine i) the accuracy of lab vs in situ calibrations using various numbers of local and/or regional soils for prediction of organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN), clay and pH; ii) effects of soil moisture content and variability on model performance for coarser and finer soils; and iii) if the method of OC determination (dry combustion vs MIRS-estimation) affects evaluation of tillage effects. Surface field MIRS measurements were made at three loess sites in Germany, each featuring three tillage treatments. Material (0–2~cm) was collected for lab MIRS measurements on dried/ground ({$<$}0.2~mm) soil and determination of OC, TN, clay and pH. Spectral Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was conducted and partial least squares regression models were created for several calibration strategies: 1) local calibrations trained with n~=~40 or 20 soils and tested with n~=~110 soils from the same site; 2) regional calibrations trained with n~=~150 or 38 soils from two sites and validated with n~=~110 soils from the third site; 3) regional calibrations trained with n~=~150 or 38 soils from two sites and n~=~20 double- or n~=~10 quadruple-weighted “spiked” soils selected from the spectral PCA to be representative of the third site, and validation with n~=~110 soils also from the third site. Spiking regional calibrations with local soils generally improved accuracy and decreased performance variability, though there were typically diminishing marginal returns to accuracy from increasing the number of local soils. The first two principal components of the lab-MIRS PCA correlated with OC, TN, clay and pH, while the field-MIRS PCA was dominated by soil moisture effects. Lab outperformed field MIRS for all models and properties. Lab MIRS n~=~38 regional models were highly accurate for OC (ratio of prediction to interquartile distance (RPIQ)~=~4.3) and TN (RPIQ~=~6.7), and estimates detected the same significant differences between tillage treatments as analysis conducted with measured values—thus, small regional models can be considered optimal (balancing accuracy and workload). For field MIRS prediction of OC and TN, calibrations with 150 regional or 38 regional plus 10 quadruple-weighted local soils achieved satisfactory accuracy (RPIQ~≥~1.89). Although predicted changes to OC in response to tillage were more biased for field MIRS, agreement with measured effects was achieved with n~=~40 local models or spiked regional models. Thus, the higher efficiency of field measurement is counterbalanced by a more arduous calibration process to achieve satisfactory accuracy. Accuracies for clay (RPIQ~=~0.89–2.8) and pH (RPIQ~=~0.60–3.2) were lower and more variable than OC and TN for both devices—thus, spiking calibrations and using more soils than OC/TN calibrations are recommended. Soil moisture more negatively affected OC prediction than clay prediction. No simple trend was established for the performances of soil subsets with low, high or variable moisture content, but accuracy was most negatively affected by moisture for the site with the highest sand content.},

If they do, then the estimates should be different and our job would consist on analyzing pairwise differences between the least generalization error estimate and each one of the range, in order to bound the set of models which might result in an equal performance. This method is illustrated applied to polynomial regression and RBF neural networks.},

  abstract = {Training samples is fundamental for crop mapping from remotely sensed images, but difficult to acquire in many regions through ground survey, causing significant challenge for crop mapping in these regions. In this paper, a transfer learning (TL) workflow is proposed to use the classification model trained in contiguous U.S.A. (CONUS) to identify crop types in other regions. The workflow is based on fact that same crop growing in different regions of world has similar temporal growth pattern. This study selected high confidence pixels across CONUS in the Cropland Data Layer (CDL) and corresponding 30-m 15-day composited NDVI time series generated from harmonized Landat-8 and Sentinel-2 (HLS) data as training samples, trained the Random Forest (RF) classification models and then applied the models to identify crop types in three test regions, namely Hengshui in China (HS), Alberta in Canada (AB), and Nebraska in USA (NE). NDVI time series with different length were used to identify crops, the effect of time-series length on classification accuracies were then evaluated. Furthermore, local training samples in the three test regions were collected and used to identify crops (LO) for comparison. Results showed that overall classification accuracies in HS, AB and NE were 97.79\%, 86.45\% and 94.86\%, respectively, when using TL with NDVI time series of the entire growing season for classification. However, LO could achieve higher classification accuracies earlier than TL. Because the training samples were collected across USA containing multiple growth conditions, it increased the potential that the crop growth environment in test regions could be similar to those of the training samples; but also led to situation that different crops had similar NDVI time series, which caused lower TL classification accuracy in HS at early-season. Generally, this study provides new options for crop classification in regions of training samples shortage.},

  abstract = {Accurate monitoring of soil organic carbon (SOC) is critical for sustainable management of soil for improving its quality, function, and carbon sequestration. As a nondestructive, efficient, and low-cost technique, mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy has shown a great potential in rapid estimation of SOC, despite limited studies of the global scale. The objective of this work was to use a globally distributed topsoil MIR spectral library with 33,039 samples to predict SOC using different modeling methods. Effects of nine fractional-order derivatives (FODs) on the predicted accuracy of SOC were evaluated using four regression algorithms (i.e., ratio index-based linear regression, RI-LR; partial least squares regression, PLSR; Cubist; convolutional neural network, CNN). Square-root transformation to SOC data was performed to minimize the skewness and non-linearity. Results indicated FOD to capture the subtle spectral details related to SOC, leading to improved predictions that may not be possible by the raw absorbance and common integer-order derivatives. Concerning the RI-LR models, the optimal validation result for SOC was obtained by 0.75-order derivative, with the ratio of performance to inter-quartile distance (RPIQ) of 1.85. Regarding the full-spectrum modeling for SOC, the CNN outperformed PLSR and Cubist models, irrespective of raw absorbance or eight FODs; the best-performing CNN model was achieved by 1.25-order derivative (validation RPIQ~=~6.33). It can be concluded that accurate estimation of SOC using large and diverse MIR spectral library at the global scale combined with deep-learning CNN model is feasible. This global-scale database is extremely valuable for us to deal with the shortage of soil data and to monitor the soils at different geographical scales.},

  abstract = {Clustering methods are often used to model energy consumption for two reasons. First, clustering is often used to process data and to improve the predictive accuracy of subsequent energy models. Second, stable clusters that are reproducible with respect to non-essential changes can be used to group, target, and interpret observed subjects. However, it is well known that clustering methods are highly sensitive to the choice of algorithms and variables. This can lead to misleading assessments of predictive accuracy and mis-interpretation of clusters in policymaking. This paper therefore introduces two methods to the modeling of energy consumption in buildings: clusterwise regression, also known as latent class regression, which integrates clustering and regression simultaneously; and cluster validation methods to measure stability. Using a large dataset of multifamily buildings in New York City, clusterwise regression is compared to common two-stage algorithms that use K-means and model-based clustering with linear regression. Predictive accuracy is evaluated using 20-fold cross validation, and the stability of the perturbed clusters is measured using the Jaccard coefficient. These results show that there seems to be an inherent tradeoff between prediction accuracy and cluster stability. This paper concludes by discussing which clustering methods may be appropriate for different analytical purposes.},

  abstract = {Statistical models can only be as good as the data put into them. Data about energy consumption continues to grow, particularly its non-technical aspects, but these variables are often interpreted differently among disciplines, datasets, and contexts. Selecting key variables and interactions is therefore an important step in achieving more accurate predictions, better interpretation, and identification of key subgroups for further analysis. This paper therefore makes two main contributions to the modeling and analysis of energy consumption of buildings. First, it introduces regularization, also known as penalized regression, for principled selection of variables and interactions. Second, this approach is demonstrated by application to a comprehensive dataset of energy consumption for commercial office and multifamily buildings in New York City. Using cross-validation, this paper finds that a newly-developed method, hierarchical group-lasso regularization, significantly outperforms ridge, lasso, elastic net and ordinary least squares approaches in terms of prediction accuracy; develops a parsimonious model for large New York City buildings; and identifies several interactions between technical and non-technical parameters for further analysis, policy development and targeting. This method is generalizable to other local contexts, and is likely to be useful for the modeling of other sectors of energy consumption as well.},

The time-window constraint for each customer is treated as a penalty function, which is very general in the sense that it can be nonconvex and discontinuous as long as it is piecewise linear. In our algorithm, we use local search to assign customers to vehicles and to find orders of customers for vehicles to visit. Our algorithm employs an advanced neighborhood, called the cyclic-exchange neighborhood, in addition to standard neighborhoods for the vehicle routing problem. After fixing the order of customers for a vehicle to visit, we must determine the optimal start times of processing at customers so that the total penalty is minimized. We show that this problem can be efficiently solved by using dynamic programming, which is then incorporated in our algorithm. We report computational results for various benchmark instances of the vehicle routing problem. The generality of time-window constraints allows us to handle a wide variety of scheduling problems. As an example, we mention in this paper an application to a production scheduling problem with inventory cost, and report computational results for real-world instances.},

  abstract = {A first part of the contribution in this thesis consists of approximation algorithms for Minimum Connected Set Cover problem (MCSC) which are published in [28]. First, we present a polylogarithmic approximation algorithm for MCSC problem that uses an approximation algorithm for the group Steiner tree problem (GST) in [37]. We also give a first approximation algorithm for the weighted version of the problem [28]. MCSC problem with demands is also considered. A demand of each element determines the smallest number of sets in the solution that covers considered element. A second part of the contribution is related to the approximation algorithm for GST problem where the size of each group is bounded by some constant. This special cases remains NPhard since it generalizes Steiner tree problem. In the thesis a constant approximation algorithm for this problem will be studied. We also give approximation algorithms for some related problems. A third part of the contribution consists of an adaptation of the algorithm for solving packing and covering linear programs, which is presented in [52], to the parallel computing platform that is supported by modern graphic NVidia chips with CUDA. Instead of updating a single entry in the primal and dual solution vector per iteration, we update a few randomly chosen entries. A part of the contribution is related to deterministic updates of many entries in the primal and dual solution vector which is more amenable for parallelization. Although it increases time per iteration, an update of multiple entries in the primal and dual vectors in one iteration will make the primal and dual vectors converge to the optimal solution much faster which leads to a fewer number of iteration. Approximation algorithms for GST problem use algorithms for solving relaxation of natural integer programming formulation [37] for GST. After integrality constraints are relaxed, a linear program becomes the covering linear program where the number of constraints is an exponential function of the input size. In the thesis, the fully polynomial time approximation scheme from [52, 62] will be adopted such that it approximates a solution of the LP relaxation of GST [51].},

  abstract = {Finding the best sequence of local search operators that yields the optimal performance of Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) is an important open research question in the field of metaheuristics. This paper proposes a Reinforcement Learning method to address this question. We introduce a new hyperheuristic scheme, termed Bandit VNS, inspired by the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB), a particular type of a single state reinforcement learning problem. In Bandit VNS, we utilize the General Variable Neighborhood Search metaheuristic and enhance it by a hyperheuristic strategy. We examine several variations of the Upper Confidence Bound algorithm to create a reliable strategy for adaptive neighborhood selection. Furthermore, we utilize Adaptive Windowing, a state of the art algorithm to estimate and detect changes in the data stream. Bandit VNS is designed for effective parallelization and encourages cooperation between agents to produce the best solution quality. We demonstrate this concept’s advantages in accuracy and speed by extensive experimentation using the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem. We compare the novel scheme’s performance against the conventional General Variable Neighborhood Search metaheuristic in terms of the CPU time and solution quality. The Bandit VNS method shows excellent results and reaches significantly higher performance metrics when applied to well-known benchmark instances. Our experiments show that, our approach achieves an improvement of more than 25\% in solution quality when compared to the General Variable Neighborhood Search method using standard library instances of medium and large size.},

The idea is to approximate missing values using only those data points that are somewhat similar to the incomplete data point. A similar idea is used also in clustering based imputation methods. Nevertheless, here the linear regression approach is used within each cluster to accurately predict the missing values, and this is done simultaneously to clustering. The proposed method is tested using some synthetic and real-world data sets and compared with other algorithms for missing value imputations. Numerical results demonstrate that this method produces the most accurate imputations in MCAR and MAR data sets with a clear structure and the percentages of missing data no more than 25 percent.},

  abstract = {In machine learning, if the training data is an unbiased sample of an underlying distribution, then the learned classification function will make accurate predictions for new samples. However, if the training data is not an unbiased sample, then there will be differences between how the training data is distributed and how the test data is distributed. Standard classifiers cannot cope with changes in data distributions between training and test phases, and will not perform well. Domain adaptation and transfer learning are sub-fields within machine learning that are concerned with accounting for these types of changes. Here, we present an introduction to these fields, guided by the question: when and how can a classifier generalize from a source to a target domain? We will start with a brief introduction into risk minimization, and how transfer learning and domain adaptation expand upon this framework. Following that, we discuss three special cases of data set shift, namely prior, covariate and concept shift. For more complex domain shifts, there are a wide variety of approaches. These are categorized into: importance-weighting, subspace mapping, domain-invariant spaces, feature augmentation, minimax estimators and robust algorithms. A number of points will arise, which we will discuss in the last section. We conclude with the remark that many open questions will have to be addressed before transfer learners and domain-adaptive classifiers become practical.},

  abstract = {Regularized models are often sensitive to the scales of the features in the data and it has therefore become standard practice to normalize (center and scale) the features before fitting the model. But there are many different ways to normalize the features and the choice may have dramatic effects on the resulting model. In spite of this, there has so far been no research on this topic. In this paper, we begin to bridge this knowledge gap by studying normalization in the context of lasso, ridge, and elastic net regression. We focus on normal and binary features and show that the class balances of binary features directly influences the regression coefficients and that this effect depends on the combination of normalization and regularization methods used. We demonstrate that this effect can be mitigated by scaling binary features with their variance in the case of the lasso and standard deviation in the case of ridge regression, but that this comes at the cost of increased variance. For the elastic net, we show that scaling the penalty weights, rather than the features, can achieve the same effect. Finally, we also tackle mixes of binary and normal features as well as interactions and provide some initial results on how to normalize features in these cases.},

  abstract = {The clusterwise regression model is used to perform cluster analysis within a regression framework. While the traditional regression model assumes the regression coefficient (β) to be identical for all subjects in the sample, the clusterwise regression model allows β to vary with subjects of different clusters. Since the cluster membership is unknown, the estimation of the clusterwise regression is a tough combinatorial optimization problem. In this research, we propose a “Generalized Clusterwise Regression Model” which is formulated as a mathematical programming (MP) problem. A nonlinear programming procedure (with linear constraints) is proposed to solve the combinatorial problem and to estimate the cluster membership and β simultaneously. Moreover, by integrating the cluster analysis with the discriminant analysis, a clusterwise discriminant model is developed to incorporate parameter heterogeneity into the traditional discriminant analysis. The cluster membership and discriminant parameters are estimated simultaneously by another nonlinear programming model.},

  abstract = {Classical clusterwise linear regression is a useful method for investigating the relationship between scalar predictors and scalar responses with heterogeneous variation of regression patterns for different subgroups of subjects. This paper extends the classical clusterwise linear regression to incorporate multiple functional predictors by representing the functional coefficients in terms of a functional principal component basis. We estimate the functional principal component coefficients based on M-estimation and K-means clustering algorithm, which can classify the data into clusters and estimate clusterwise coefficients simultaneously. One advantage of the proposed method is that it is robust and flexible by adopting a general loss function, which can be broadly applied to mean regression, median regression, quantile regression and robust mean regression. A Bayesian information criterion is proposed to select the unknown number of groups and shown to be consistent in model selection. We also obtain the convergence rate of the set of estimators to the set of true coefficients for all clusters. Simulation studies and real data analysis show that the proposed method is easily implemented, and it consequently improves previous works and also requires much less computing burden than existing methods.},

  abstract = {The Group Steiner Tree (GST) problem is a fundamental problem in database area that has been successfully applied to keyword search in relational databases and team search in social networks. The state-of-the-art algorithm for the GST problem is a parameterized dynamic programming (DP) algorithm, which finds the optimal tree in O(3kn+2k(n log n + m)) time, where k is the number of given groups, m and n are the number of the edges and nodes of the graph respectively. The major limitations of the parameterized DP algorithm are twofold: (i) it is intractable even for very small values of k (e.g., k=8) in large graphs due to its exponential complexity, and (ii) it cannot generate a solution until the algorithm has completed its entire execution. To overcome these limitations, we propose an efficient and progressive GST algorithm in this paper, called PrunedDP. It is based on newly-developed optimal-tree decomposition and conditional tree merging techniques. The proposed algorithm not only drastically reduces the search space of the parameterized DP algorithm, but it also produces progressively-refined feasible solutions during algorithm execution. To further speed up the PrunedDP algorithm, we propose a progressive A*-search algorithm, based on several carefully-designed lower-bounding techniques. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our algorithms on several large scale real-world graphs. The results show that our best algorithm is not only able to generate progressively-refined feasible solutions, but it also finds the optimal solution with at least two orders of magnitude acceleration over the state-of-the-art algorithm, using much less memory.},

However, detecting such management practices in smallholder systems is challenging given that the size of fields is smaller than historical readily-available satellite imagery. In this study we used newer, higher-resolution satellite data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Planet to map tillage practices in the Eastern Indo-Gangetic Plains in India. We specifically tested the classification performance of single sensor and multiple sensor random forest models, and the impact of spatial, temporal, or spectral resolution on classification accuracy. We found that when considering a single sensor, the model that used Planet imagery (3 m) had the highest classification accuracy (86.55\%) while the model that used Sentinel-1 data (10 m) had the lowest classification accuracy (62.28\%). When considering sensor combinations, the model that used data from all three sensors achieved the highest classification accuracy (87.71\%), though this model was not statistically different from the Planet only model when considering 95\% confidence intervals from bootstrap analyses. We also found that high levels of accuracy could be achieved by only using imagery from the sowing period. Considering the impact of spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution on classification accuracy, we found that improved spatial resolution from Planet contributed the most to improved classification accuracy. Overall, it is possible to use readily-available, high spatial resolution satellite data to map tillage practices of smallholder farms, even in heterogeneous systems with small field sizes.},

  abstract = {Recently, statistical machine learning and deep learning methods have been widely explored for corn yield prediction. Though successful, machine learning models generated within a specific spatial domain often lose their validity when directly applied to new regions. To address this issue, we designed an unsupervised adaptive domain adversarial neural network (ADANN). Specifically, through domain adversarial training, the ADANN model reduced the impact of domain shift by projecting data from different domains into the same subspace. Also, the ADANN model was designed to be trained in an adaptive way, which guaranteed the model can learn the domain-invariant features and perform accurate yield prediction simultaneously. Informative variables including time-series vegetation indices and sequential weather observations were first collected from multiple data sources and aggregated to the county level. Then, we trained the ADANN model with the extracted features and corresponding reported county-level corn yield from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Finally, the trained model was evaluated in four testing years 2016–2019. The U.S. corn belt was used as the study area and counties under study were grouped into two diverse ecological regions. The experimental results showed that the developed ADANN model had better performance than three other state-of-the-art machine learning models in both local experiments (train and test in the same region) and transfer experiments (train and test in different regions). As the first study using adversarial learning for crop yield prediction, this research demonstrates a novel solution for improving model transferability on crop yield prediction.},

Numerous applications of this NP-hard problem initiated researchers to study it from both theoretical and algorithmic aspects. One of the challenges is to provide a good heuristic solution within the reasonable amount of CPU time. We propose the application of metaheuristic framework based on Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) and related approaches. One of our main objectives is to find a neighborhood structure that ensures efficient implementation. We develop Variable Neighborhood Descend (VND) algorithm that can be the main ingredient of several local search approaches. Experimental evaluation involves comparison of our heuristic to exact approach based on Integer Linear Programming solvers and other metaheuristic approaches, such as genetic algorithm. The obtained results show that the proposed method always outperforms genetic algorithm. Exact method is outperformed in the case of instances with large number of groups.},

On the other hand, these types of data fields are quite common in real-world data mining applications and often contain potentially relevant information that is difficult to represent for modeling purposes.This paper presents a simple preprocessing scheme for high-cardinality categorical data that allows this class of attributes to be used in predictive models such as neural networks, linear and logistic regression. The proposed method is based on a well-established statistical method (empirical Bayes) that is straightforward to implement as an in-database procedure. Furthermore, for categorical attributes with an inherent hierarchical structure, like ZIP codes, the preprocessing scheme can directly leverage the hierarchy by blending statistics at the various levels of aggregation.While the statistical methods discussed in this paper were first introduced in the mid 1950's, the use of these methods as a preprocessing step for complex models, like neural networks, has not been previously discussed in any literature.}

  abstract = {Soil texture is an important property that controls the mobility of the water and nutrients in soil. This study examined the capability of machine learning (ML) models in estimating soil texture fractions using different combinations of remotely sensed data from Sentinel-1 (S1), Sentinel-2 (S2), and terrain-derived covariates (TDC) across two contrasting agroecological regions in Southwest Germany, Kraichgau and the Swabian Alb. Importantly, we tested the predictive power of three different ML models: the random forest (RF), the support vector machine (SVM), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) coupled with the remote sensing data covariates. As expected, ML model performance was not consistent regarding the input covariates, soil texture fractions, and study regions. For example, in the Swabian Alb, the SVM model performed the best for the sand content with S2 + TDC (RMSE = 3.63\%, R2 = 0.42), and XGB best predicted the clay content with S1 + S2 + TDC (RMSE = 6.84\%, R2 = 0.64). In Kraichgau, the best models for sand (RMSE = 7.54\%, R2 = 0.79) and clay contents (RMSE = 6.14\%, R2 = 0.48) were obtained using XGB and SVM, respectively. Moreover, the results indicated that TDC were critical in estimating soil texture fractions, especially in Kraichgau, which indicated that topography plays an important role in defining the spatial distribution of soil properties. In contrast, the contribution of remote sensing data better predicted the silt and clay content in the Swabian Alb. The transferability of a region-specific model to the other region was low as indicated by poor predictive performance. The resulting soil-texture-fraction maps could be a significant source of information for efficient land resource management and environmental monitoring. Nonetheless, further research to evaluate the added value of the Sentinel imagery and to better analyze the spatial transferability of machine learning models is highly recommended.},

  abstract = {Precise and timely information about crop types plays a crucial role in various agriculture-related applications. However, crop type mapping methods often face significant challenges in cross-regional and cross-time scenarios with high discrepancies between temporal-spectral characteristics of crops from different regions and years. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods have been employed to mitigate the problem of domain shift between the source and target domains. Since these methods require source domain data during the adaptation phase, they demand significant computational resources and data storage, especially when large labeled crop mapping source datasets are available. This leads to increased energy consumption and financial costs. To address this limitation, we developed a source-free UDA method for cross-regional and cross-time crop mapping, capable of adapting the source-pretrained models to the target datasets without requiring the source datasets. The method mitigates the domain shift problem by leveraging mutual information loss. The diversity and discriminability terms in the loss function are balanced through a novel unsupervised weighting strategy based on mean confidence scores of the predicted categories. Our experiments on mapping corn, soybean, and the class Other from Landsat image time series in the U.S. demonstrated that the adapted models using different backbone networks outperformed their non-adapted counterparts. With CNN, Transformer, and LSTM backbone networks, our adaptation method increased the macro F1 scores by 12.9\%, 7.1\%, and 5.8\% on average in cross-time tests and by 20.1\%, 12.5\%, and 8.8\% on average in cross-regional tests, respectively. Additionally, in an experiment covering a large study area of 450 km × 300 km, the adapted model with the CNN backbone network obtained a macro F1 score of 92.6\%, outperforming its non-adapted counterpart with a macro F1 score of 89.2\%. Our experiments on mapping the same classes using Sentinel-2 image times series in France demonstrated the effectiveness of our method across different countries and sensors. We also tested our method in more diverse agricultural areas in Denmark and France containing six classes. The results showed that the adapted models outperformed the non-adapted models. Moreover, in within-season experiments, the adapted models performed better than the non-adapted models in the vast majority of weeks. These results and their comparison to those obtained by the other investigated UDA methods demonstrated the efficiency of our proposed method for both end-of-season and within-season crop mapping tasks. Additionally, our study showed that the method is modular and flexible in employing various backbone networks.

  abstract = {No single instrument can characterize all soil properties because soil is a complex material. With the advancement of technology, laboratories have become equipped with various spectrometers. By fusing output from different spectrometers, better prediction outcomes are expected than using any single spectrometer alone. In this study, model performance from a single spectrometer (visible-near-infrared spectroscopy, vis-NIR or mid-infrared spectroscopy, MIR) was compared to the combined spectrometers (vis-NIR and MIR). We selected a total of 14,594 samples from the Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory (KSSL) database that had both vis-NIR and MIR spectra along with measurements of sand, clay, total C (TC) content, organic C (OC) content, cation exchange capacity (CEC), and pH. The dataset was randomly split into 75\% training (n\,=\,10,946) and the remaining (n\,=\,3,648) as a test set. Prediction models were constructed with partial least squares regression (PLSR) and Cubist tree model. Additionally, we explored the use of a deep learning model, the convolutional neural network (CNN). We investigated various ways to feed spectral data to the CNN, either as one-dimensional (1D) data (as a spectrum) or as two-dimensional (2D) data (as a spectrogram). Compared to the PLSR model, we found that the CNN model provides an average improvement prediction of 33–42\% using vis-NIR and 30–43\% using MIR spectral data input. The relative accuracy improvement of CNN, when compared to the Cubist regression tree model, ranged between 22 and 36\% with vis-NIR and 16–27\% with MIR spectral data input. Various methods to fuse the vis-NIR and MIR spectral data were explored. We compared the performance of spectral concatenation (for PLSR and Cubist model), two-channel input method, and outer product analysis (OPA) method (for CNN model). We found that the performance of two-channel 1D CNN model was the best (R2\,=\,0.95–0.98) followed closely by the OPA with CNN (R2\,=\,0.93–0.98), Cubist model with spectral concatenation (R2\,=\,0.91–0.97), two-channel 2D CNN model (R2\,=\,0.90–0.95) and PLSR with spectral concatenation (R2\,=\,0.87–0.95). Chemometric analysis of spectroscopy data relied on spectral pre-processing methods: such as spectral trimming, baseline correction, smoothing, and normalization before being fed into the model. CNN achieved higher performance than the PLSR and Cubist model without utilizing the pre-processed spectral data. We also found that the predictions using the CNN model retained similar correlations to the actual values in comparison to other models. By doing sensitivity analysis, we identified the important spectral wavelengths variables used by the CNN model to predict various soil properties. CNN is an effective model for modelling soil properties from a large spectral library.},

  abstract = {Quantitative assessment of soil functions requires the characterization of soil capability and condition. Mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy has been suggested as a viable alternative to the wet chemistry method. However, the extensive set of soil properties that can be well predicted have yet to be explored. The USDA MIR spectral library contains approximately 45,000 samples with more than 119 soil properties. This unique dataset allows us to establish which soil properties that can be accurately measured. Memory-based learning (MBL) algorithm achieved higher accuracy than the Cubist. The prediction accuracies of different properties were then categorized further into four classes (A, B, C, and D) based on four accuracy metrics, namely coefficient of determination (R2), Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (LCCC), ratio of performance to the interquartile range (RPIQ), and standardized bias (Stb). We found that a single MIR spectrum can infer 50 soil properties with high accuracy (A or B category), and 44 properties can be estimated approximately (C category). These properties can then be used to evaluate a range of soil functions, including food production, carbon storage, water storage, nutrient cycling, and habitat function.},

  abstract = {We study the complete set packing problem (CSPP) where the family of feasible subsets may include all possible combinations of objects. This setting arises in applications such as combinatorial auctions (for selecting optimal bids) and cooperative game theory (for finding optimal coalition structures). Although the set packing problem has been well-studied in the literature, where exact and approximation algorithms can solve very large instances with up to hundreds of objects and thousands of feasible subsets, these methods are not extendable to the CSPP since the number of feasible subsets is exponentially large. Formulating the CSPP as an MILP and solving it directly, using CPLEX for example, is impossible for problems with more than 20 objects. We propose a new mathematical formulation for the CSPP that directly leads to an efficient algorithm for finding feasible set packings (upper bounds). We also propose a new formulation for finding tighter lower bounds compared to LP relaxation and develop an efficient method for solving the corresponding large-scale MILP. We test the algorithm with the winner determination problem in spectrum auctions, the coalition structure generation problem in coalitional skill games, and a number of other simulated problems that appear in the literature.},

  abstract = {Crop type mapping currently represents an important problem in remote sensing. Accurate information on the extent and types of crops derived from remote sensing can help managing and improving agriculture especially for developing countries where such information is scarce. In this paper, high-resolution RGB drone images are the input data for the classification performed using a transfer learning (TL) approach. VGG16 and GoogLeNet, which are pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used for classification tasks coming from computer vision, are considered for the mapping of the crop types. Thanks to the transferred knowledge, the proposed models can successfully classify the studied crop types with high overall accuracy for two considered cases, achieving up to almost 83\% for the Malawi dataset and up to 90\% for the Mozambique dataset. Notably, these results are comparable to the ones achieved by the same deep CNN architectures in many computer vision tasks. With regard to drone data analysis, application of deep CNN is very limited so far due to high requirements on the number of samples needed to train such complicated architectures. Our results demonstrate that the transfer learning is an efficient way to overcome this problem and take full advantage of the benefits of deep CNN ar­ chitectures for drone-based crop type mapping. Moreover, based on experiments with different TL approaches we show that the number of frozen layers is an important parameter of TL and a fine-tuning of all the CNN weights results in significantly better performance than the approaches that apply fine-tuning only on some numbers of last layers.},

  abstract = {A major assumption in many machine learning and data mining algorithms is that the training and future data must be in the same feature space and have the same distribution. However, in many real-world applications, this assumption may not hold. For example, we sometimes have a classification task in one domain of interest, but we only have sufficient training data in another domain of interest, where the latter data may be in a different feature space or follow a different data distribution. In such cases, knowledge transfer, if done successfully, would greatly improve the performance of learning by avoiding much expensive data-labeling efforts. In recent years, transfer learning has emerged as a new learning framework to address this problem. This survey focuses on categorizing and reviewing the current progress on transfer learning for classification, regression, and clustering problems. In this survey, we discuss the relationship between transfer learning and other related machine learning techniques such as domain adaptation, multitask learning and sample selection bias, as well as covariate shift. We also explore some potential future issues in transfer learning research.},

A common problem are high cardinality features, i.e.~unordered categorical predictor variables with a high number of levels. We study techniques that yield numeric representations of categorical variables which can then be used in subsequent ML applications. We focus on the impact of these techniques on a subsequent algorithm’s predictive performance, and—if possible—derive best practices on when to use which technique. We conducted a large-scale benchmark experiment, where we compared different encoding strategies together with five ML algorithms (lasso, random forest, gradient boosting, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine) using datasets from regression, binary- and multiclass–classification settings. In our study, regularized versions of target encoding (i.e.~using target predictions based on the feature levels in the training set as a new numerical feature) consistently provided the best results. Traditionally widely used encodings that make unreasonable assumptions to map levels to integers (e.g.~integer encoding) or to reduce the number of levels (possibly based on target information, e.g.~leaf encoding) before creating binary indicator variables (one-hot or dummy encoding) were not as effective in comparison.},

When labeled samples are unavailable or labeled samples have different distributions from that of the samples to be classified, the classification model may fail. The cross-domain or cross-scene remote sensing image classification is developed for this case where an existing image for training and an unknown image from different scenes or domains for classification. The distribution inconsistency problem may be caused by the differences in acquisition environment conditions, acquisition scene, acquisition time, and/or changing sensors. To cope with the cross-domain remote sensing image classification problem, many domain adaptation (DA) techniques have been developed. In this article, we review DA methods in the fields of RS, especially hyperspectral image classification, and provide a survey of DA methods into traditional shallow DA methods (e.g., instance-based, feature-based, and classifier-based adaptations) and recently developed deep DA methods (e.g., discrepancy-based and adversarial-based adaptations).},

Vegetation phenological phenomena are closely related to seasonal dynamics of the lower atmosphere and are therefore important elements in global models and vegetation monitoring. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data derived from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite sensor offer a means of efficiently and objectively evaluating phenological characteristics over large areas. Twelve metrics linked to key phenological events were computed based on time-series NDVI data collected from 1989 to 1992 over the conterminous United States. These measures include the onset of greenness, time of peak NDVI, maximum NDVI, rate of greenup, rate of senescence, and integrated NDVI. Measures of central tendency and variability of the measures were computed and analyzed for various land cover types. Results from the analysis showed strong coincidence between the satellite-derived metrics and predicted phenological characteristics. In particular, the metrics identified interannual variability of spring wheat in North Dakota, characterized the phenology of four types of grasslands, and established the phenological consistency of deciduous and coniferous forests. These results have implications for large-area land cover mapping and monitoring. The utility of remotely sensed data as input to vegetation mapping is demonstrated by showing the distinct phenology of several land cover types. More stable information contained in ancillary data should be incorporated into the mapping process, particularly in areas with high phenological variability. In a regional or global monitoring system, an increase in variability in a region may serve as a signal to perform more detailed land cover analysis with higher resolution imagery.},

  abstract = {The prize-collecting Steiner tree problem (PCSTP) is a well-known generalization of the classic Steiner tree problem in graphs, with a large number of practical applications. It attracted particular interest during the 11th DIMACS Challenge in 2014, and since then, several PCSTP solvers have been introduced in the literature. Although these new solvers further, and often drastically, improved on the results of the DIMACS Challenge, many PCSTP benchmark instances have remained unsolved. The following article describes further advances in the state of the art in exact PCSTP solving. It introduces new techniques and algorithms for PCSTP, involving various new transformations (or reductions) of PCSTP instances to equivalent problems, for example, to decrease the problem size or to obtain a better integer programming formulation. Several of the new techniques and algorithms provably dominate previous approaches. Further theoretical properties of the new components, such as their complexity, are discussed. Also, new complexity results for the exact solution of PCSTP and related problems are described, which form the base of the algorithm design. Finally, the new developments also translate into a strong computational performance: the resulting exact PCSTP solver outperforms all previous approaches, both in terms of runtime and solvability. In particular, it solves several formerly intractable benchmark instances from the 11th DIMACS Challenge to optimality. Moreover, several recently introduced large-scale instances with up to 10 million edges, previously considered to be too large for any exact approach, can now be solved to optimality in less than two hours. Summary of Contribution: The prize-collecting Steiner tree problem (PCSTP) is a well-known generalization of the classic Steiner tree problem in graphs, with many practical applications. The article introduces and analyses new techniques and algorithms for PCSTP that ultimately aim for improved (practical) exact solution. The algorithmic developments are underpinned by results on theoretical aspects, such as fixed-parameter tractability of PCSTP. Computationally, we considerably push the limits of tractibility, being able to solve PCSTP instances with up to 10 million edges. The new solver, which also considerably outperforms the state of the art on smaller instances, will be made publicly available as part of the SCIP Optimization Suite.},

  abstract = {In engineering problems, reliability assessment is often computationally expensive. Surrogate models with active learning approaches are commonly used to solve this problem. Kriging is one of the most popular surrogate models used in this domain. Recently, artificial neural networks (ANN) have also attracted a lot of interest for structural reliability assessment due to their powerful capability. Many active learning approaches have been developed based on Kriging models and ANN. But selecting an appropriate model or technique for a reliability assessment problem with limited knowledge of the limit state function remains a challenging task. Ensemble of surrogates seems to be a good approach to tackle this challenge. In this work, two active learning approaches are proposed to combine Kriging and ANN models for reliability analysis. One is the local best surrogate (LBS) approach and the other is the local weighted average surrogate (LWAS) approach. Cross-validation and Jackknife techniques are used to estimate prediction errors of the surrogate models. In addition, two methods are proposed to locally measure the goodness of the surrogate models and calculate the prediction errors of the ensemble of surrogates. The surrogate models are updated by selecting the new sample points that have large prediction errors and are close to the limit state. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed approaches are demonstrated by 4 representative examples and two finite element problems. The results show that the proposed methods can be effective in evaluating the reliability of high dimension and rare event problems with less computational costs than the single typical surrogate model with active learning approaches (e.g. AK-MCS). Moreover, compared with the ensemble of surrogate models based on global goodness measurement, the proposed approaches also outperform in most cases. Finally, it should be mentioned that the proposed approaches are not only suitable for the combination of Kriging and ANN but also can be extended to other multiple surrogate models including support vector machine, polynomial chaos expansion, and so on.},

It is well known that modulo a logarithmic factor it suffices to consider acyclic graphs where the nodes are arranged in L {$<$}= log |X| levels. Unfortunately the natural LP formulation has a |X|\textasciicircum (1/2) integrality gap already for 5 levels. We show that for every L, the O(L)-round Lasserre Strengthening of this LP has integrality gap O(L log |X|). This provides a polynomial time |X|\textasciicircum\{epsilon\}-approximation and a O(log\textasciicircum 3 |X|) approximation in O(n\textasciicircum\{log |X|) time, matching the best known approximation guarantee obtained by a greedy algorithm of Charikar et al.\vphantom\}},

  abstract = {The amount of available Earth observation data has increased dramatically in recent years. Efficiently making use of the entire body of information is a current challenge in remote sensing; it demands lightweight problem-agnostic models that do not require region- or problem-specific expert knowledge. End-to-end trained deep learning models can make use of raw sensory data by learning feature extraction and classification in one step, solely from data. Still, many methods proposed in remote sensing research require implicit feature extraction through data preprocessing or explicit design of features. In this work, we compare recent deep learning models on crop type classification on raw and preprocessed Sentinel 2 data. We concentrate on the common neural network architectures for time series, i.e., 1D-convolutions, recurrence, and the novel self-attention architecture. Our central findings are that data preprocessing still increased the overall classification performance for all models while the choice of model was less crucial. Self-attention and recurrent neural networks, by their architecture, outperformed convolutional neural networks on raw satellite time series. We explore this by a feature importance analysis based on gradient backpropagation that exploits the differentiable nature of deep learning models. Further, we qualitatively show how self-attention scores focus selectively on a few classification-relevant observations.},

In particular, large-scale control of agricultural parcels is an issue of major political and economic importance. In this regard, hybrid convolutional-recurrent neural architectures have shown promising results for the automated classification of satellite image time series. We propose an alternative approach in which the convolutional layers are advantageously replaced with encoders operating on unordered sets of pixels to exploit the typically coarse resolution of publicly available satellite images. We also propose to extract temporal features using a bespoke neural architecture based on self-attention instead of recurrent networks. We demonstrate experimentally that our method not only outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches in terms of precision, but also significantly decreases processing time and memory requirements. Lastly, we release a large open-access annotated dataset as a benchmark for future work on satellite image time series.},

  abstract = {This paper puts forward an integrated optimisation model that combines three distinct problems, namely berth allocation, quay crane assignment, and quay crane scheduling that arise in container ports. Each one of these problems is difficult to solve in its own right. However, solving them individually leads almost surely to sub-optimal solutions. Hence, it is desirable to solve them in a combined form. The model is of the mixed-integer programming type with the objective being to minimize the tardiness of vessels and reduce the cost of berthing. Experimental results show that relatively small instances of the proposed model can be solved exactly using CPLEX. Large scale instances, however, can only be solved in reasonable times using heuristics. Here, an implementation of the genetic algorithm is considered. The effectiveness of this implementation is tested against CPLEX on small to medium size instances of the combined model. Larger size instances were also solved with the genetic algorithm, showing that this approach is capable of finding the optimal or near optimal solutions in realistic times.},

  abstract = {User-centered logistics that aim at customer satisfaction are gaining importance because of growing e-commerce and home deliveries. Customer satisfaction can be strongly increased by offering narrow delivery time windows. However, there is a tradeoff for the logistics provider because user-friendly delivery time windows might decrease operational flexibility. Against this background, we study the vehicle routing problem with multiple time windows (VRPMTW) that determines a set of optimal routes such that each customer is visited once within one out of several time windows. We present a large neighborhood search–based metaheuristic for the VRPMTW that contains a dynamic programming component to optimally select a time window for each customer on a route, and we present computationally efficient move descriptors for all search operators. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm on the Belhaiza instance set for the objectives of minimizing traveled distance and duration. For the former objective, we provide new best-known solutions for 9 of 48 instances, and for the latter, we provide new best-known solutions for 13 of 48 instances. Overall, our algorithm provides the best average solution quality over the full benchmark set among all available algorithms. Furthermore, we design new benchmark instances that reflect planning tasks in user-centered last-mile logistics. Based on these, we present managerial studies that show the benefit of our algorithm for practitioners and allow to derive insights on how to offer time windows to customers. We show that offering multiple time windows can be economically beneficial for the logistics service providers and increases customer flexibility simultaneously.},

This paper introduces a novel behaviour-inspired suggestion algorithm named the TimeFly-PPSE algorithm, which operates on the concept of changing user's motives around time. The suggested model takes temporal knowledge into account and monitors the progression of consumers and items that are useful in providing adequate recommendations. The latter outlines a framework that enrolls the user's shifting behaviour to include guidance for personalisation. TimeFly's findings are contrasted with those of other well-known algorithms. Simulation test on 100K MovieLens dataset shows that utilising TimeFly contributes to recommendations that are exceptionally efficient and reliable.},

Given a set of customers that must be visited on the same day regularly within some period of time, the first-stage decisions are to assign to each customer a time window from a set of candidate time windows before demand is known. In the second stage, when demand is revealed for each day of the time period, vehicle routes satisfying vehicle capacity and the assigned time windows are constructed. The objective of the DTWAVRP is to minimize the expected total transportation cost. To solve this problem, we develop an exact branch-price-and-cut algorithm and derive from it five column generation heuristics that allow to solve larger instances than those solved by the exact algorithm. We illustrate the performance of these algorithms by means of computational experiments performed on randomly generated instances.},

  abstract = {The two-dimensional heterogeneous vector bin packing problem (2DHet-VBPP) consists of packing the set of items into the set of various type bins, respecting their two resource limits. The problem is to minimize the total cost of all bins. The problem, known to be NP-hard, can be formulated as a pure integer linear program, but optimal solutions can be obtained by the CPLEX Optimizer engine only for small instances. This paper proposes a metaheuristic approach to the 2DHet-VBPP, based on Reduced variable neighborhood search (RVNS). All RVNS elements are adapted to the considered problem and many procedures are designed to improve efficiency of the method. As the Two-dimensional Homogeneous-VBPP (2DHom-VBPP) is more often treated, we considered also a special version of the RVNS algorithm to solve the 2DHom-VBPP. The results obtained and compared to both CPLEX results and results on benchmark instances from literature, justify the use of the RVNS algorithm to solve large instances of these optimization problems.},

  abstract = {Automated Valuation Models (AVMs) based on Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are widely used for predicting house prices. While there is consensus in the literature that cross-validation (CV) should be used for model selection in this context, the interdisciplinary nature of the subject has made it hard to reach consensus over which metrics to use at each stage of the CV exercise. We collect 48 metrics (from the AVM literature and elsewhere) and classify them into seven groups according to their structure. Each of these groups focuses on a particular aspect of the error distribution. Depending on the type of data and the purpose of the AVM, the needs of users may be met by some classes, but not by others. In addition, we show in an empirical application how the choice of metric can influence the choice of model, by applying each metric to evaluate five commonly used AVM models. Finally – since it is not always practicable to produce 48 different performance metrics – we provide a short list of 7 metrics that are well suited to evaluate AVMs. These metrics satisfy a symmetry condition that we find is important for AVM performance, and can provide a good overall model performance ranking.},

  abstract = {Given an undirected graph and a number of vertex groups, the group Steiner tree problem is to find a tree such that (i) this tree contains at least one vertex in each vertex group; and (ii) the sum of vertex and edge weights in this tree is minimized. Solving this problem is useful in various scenarios, ranging from social networks to knowledge graphs. Most existing work focuses on solving this problem in vertex-unweighted graphs, and not enough work has been done to solve this problem in graphs with both vertex and edge weights. Here, we develop several algorithms to address this issue. Initially, we extend two algorithms from vertex-unweighted graphs to vertex- and edge-weighted graphs. The first one has no approximation guarantee, but often produces good solutions in practice. The second one has an approximation guarantee of |Γ| − 1, where |Γ| is the number of vertex groups. Since the extended (|Γ| − 1)approximation algorithm is too slow when all vertex groups are large, we develop two new (|Γ| − 1)-approximation algorithms that overcome this weakness. Furthermore, by employing a dynamic programming approach, we develop another (|Γ| −ℎ +1)-approximation algorithm, where ℎ is a parameter between 2 and |Γ|. Experiments show that, while no algorithm is the best in all cases, our algorithms considerably outperform the state of the art in many scenarios.},

Tea stems have become a major physical pollutant for finishing tea products, and they cannot be effectively detected with machine vision in the visible region. In the current study, terahertz time domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) and imaging was employed to rapidly and non-destructively detect tea stalk foreign bodies in tea leaves. With the input variables of THz time-domain signal and frequency-domain absorption coefficients, the K nearest neighbor (KNN) qualitative discriminant models were developed with combination of baseline correction algorithms of adaptive iteratively reweighted penalized least squares (AirPLS), asymmetric least squares (AsLS), background correction (Backcor) and baseline estimation and denoising with sparsity (BEADS). Results showed that the AirPLS-KNN model with the input vector of THz time-domain signals presented the best performance, with the accuracy rate of prediction and recall rate reaching 97.3\% and 0.96, respectively. With 0.2~mm step length of both the~X~and Y directions, the THz transmission imaging was scanned to obtain the THz image of 150X130 pixel2 whose resolution and imaging duration were 1.09~mm and 4.4~min respectively, so the outline of tea stalks could be well identified. In conclusion, the THz-TDS and imaging technology serves as a new means for non-destructive detection of tea stalk foreign bodies in tea leaves.},

  abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are powerful models that have achieved excellent performance on difficult learning tasks. Although DNNs work well whenever large labeled training sets are available, they cannot be used to map sequences to sequences. In this paper, we present a general end-to-end approach to sequence learning that makes minimal assumptions on the sequence structure. Our method uses a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to a vector of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the target sequence from the vector. Our main result is that on an English to French translation task from the WMT-14 dataset, the translations produced by the LSTM achieve a BLEU score of 34.8 on the entire test set, where the LSTM's BLEU score was penalized on out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, the LSTM did not have difficulty on long sentences. For comparison, a phrase-based SMT system achieves a BLEU score of 33.3 on the same dataset. When we used the LSTM to rerank the 1000 hypotheses produced by the aforementioned SMT system, its BLEU score increases to 36.5, which is close to the previous state of the art. The LSTM also learned sensible phrase and sentence representations that are sensitive to word order and are relatively invariant to the active and the passive voice. Finally, we found that reversing the order of the words in all source sentences (but not target sentences) improved the LSTM's performance markedly, because doing so introduced many short term dependencies between the source and the target sentence which made the optimization problem easier.},

The performance of methods was evaluated using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) indexes.

We present applications of this work to (regularized) logistic regression, Cox's proportional hazards model and the graphical lasso. We do not provide rigorous proofs here of the claimed results, but rather conceptual and theoretical sketches.},

  abstract = {We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The ‘lasso’ minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

As a consequence, the efficient management of container terminals has become a crucial issue. In this work we concentrate on the integrated seaside operations, namely the integration of berth allocation, quay crane assignment and quay crane scheduling problems. First, we formulate a mixed-integer linear program whose exact solution gives optimal berthing positions and berthing times of the vessels, along with their crane schedules during their stay at the quay. Then, we propose an efficient cutting plane algorithm based on a decomposition scheme. Our approach deals with berthing positions of the vessels and their assigned number of cranes in each time period in a master problem, and seeks the corresponding optimal crane schedule by solving a subproblem. We prove that the crane scheduling subproblem is NP-complete under general cost settings, but can be solved in polynomial time for certain special cases. Our computational study shows that our new formulation and proposed solution method yield optimal solutions for realistic-sized instances.},

  abstract = {Accurate crop mapping is critical for agricultural applications. Although studies have combined deep learning methods and time-series satellite images to crop classification with satisfactory results, most of them focused on supervised methods, which are usually applicable to a specific domain and lose their validity in new domains. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) was proposed to solve this limitation by transferring knowledge from source domains with labeled samples to target domains with unlabeled samples. Particularly, multi-source UDA (MUDA) is a powerful extension that leverages knowledge from multiple source domains and can achieve better results in the target domain than single-source UDA (SUDA). However, few studies have explored the potential of MUDA for crop mapping. This study proposed a MUDA crop classification model (MUCCM) for unsupervised crop mapping. Specifically, 11 states in the U.S. were selected as the multi-source domains, and three provinces in Northeast China were selected as individual target domains. Ten spectral bands and five vegetation indexes were collected at a 10-day interval from time-series Sentinel-2 images to build the MUCCM. Subsequently, a SUDA model Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) and two direct transfer methods, namely, the deep neural network and random forest, were constructed and compared with the MUCCM. The results indicated that the UDA models outperformed the direct transfer models significantly, and the MUCCM was superior to the DANN, achieving the highest classification accuracy (OA{$>$}85\%) in each target domain. In addition, the MUCCM also performed best in in-season forecasting and crop mapping. This study is the first to apply a MUDA to crop classification and demonstrate a novel, effective solution for high-performance crop mapping in regions without labeled samples.},

Of crucial importance though is the choice of the kernel function, which determines the mapping between the input space and the feature space. The past few years have seen many efforts in learning either the kernel function or the kernel matrix. In this paper, we study the problem of learning the kernel hyperparameter in the context of the kernelized LASSO regression model. Specifically, we propose a solution path algorithm with respect to the hyperparameter of the kernel function. As the kernel hyperparameter changes its value, the solution path can be traced exactly without having to train the model multiple times. As a result, the optimal solution can be identified efficiently. Some simulation results will be presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed kernel path algorithm.},

It also requires that the delivery service time is within the selected time windows and that the total demand of the customers served by the vehicle on each trip does not exceed the maximum carrying capacity. For solving the studied problem, we develop a mixed integer linear programming model with the objective of minimizing the total travel distance of vehicles and design a tailored iterative local search heuristic. Within the framework of the iterative local search, an improved Solomon greedy insertion algorithm suitable for multiple time windows and multi-trip scenarios is designed to generate the initial solution, and local search operators such as Or-opt and Relocate, as well as Random Exchange perturbation operations, are also developed. The experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm and confirm that by providing customers with multiple time windows option, carriers can flexibly plan vehicle routes and select appropriate service time windows, thereby reducing the number of vehicles used and the total distance travelled and improve delivery success.},

  abstract = {Spatiotemporal kriging is an important application in spatiotemporal data analysis, aiming to recover/interpolate signals for unsampled/unobserved locations based on observed signals. The principle challenge for spatiotemporal kriging is how to effectively model and leverage the spatiotemporal dependencies within the data. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great promise for spatiotemporal kriging tasks. However, standard GNNs often require a carefully designed adjacency matrix and specific aggregation functions, which are inflexible for general applications/problems. To address this issue, we present SATCN -- Spatial Aggregation and Temporal Convolution Networks -- a universal and flexible framework to perform spatiotemporal kriging for various spatiotemporal datasets without the need for model specification. Specifically, we propose a novel spatial aggregation network (SAN) inspired by Principal Neighborhood Aggregation, which uses multiple aggregation functions to help one node gather diverse information from its neighbors. To exclude information from unsampled nodes, a masking strategy that prevents the unsampled sensors from sending messages to their neighborhood is introduced to SAN. We capture temporal dependencies by the temporal convolutional networks, which allows our model to cope with data of diverse sizes. To make SATCN generalizable to unseen nodes and even unseen graph structures, we employ an inductive strategy to train SATCN. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world spatiotemporal datasets, including traffic speed and climate recordings. Our results demonstrate the superiority of SATCN over traditional and GNN-based kriging models.},

  abstract = {Consider an edge-weighted graph, and a number of properties of interests (PoIs). Each vertex has a probability of exhibiting each PoI. The joint probability that a set of vertices exhibits a PoI is the probability that this set contains at least one vertex that exhibits this PoI. The probabilistic group Steiner tree problem is to find a tree such that (i) for each PoI, the joint probability that the set of vertices in this tree exhibits this PoI is no smaller than a threshold value, e.g., 0.97; and (ii) the total weight of edges in this tree is the minimum. Solving this problem is useful for mining various graphs with uncertain vertex properties, but is NP-hard. The existing work focuses on certain cases, and cannot perform this task. To meet this challenge, we propose 3 approximation algorithms for solving the above problem. Let |Γ| be the number of PoIs, and ξ be an upper bound of the number of vertices for satisfying the threshold value of exhibiting each PoI. Algorithms 1 and 2 have tight approximation guarantees proportional to |Γ| and ξ, and exponential time complexities with respect to ξ and |Γ|, respectively. In comparison, Algorithm 3 has a looser approximation guarantee proportional to, and a polynomial time complexity with respect to, both |Γ| and ξ. Experiments on real and large datasets show that the proposed algorithms considerably outperform the state-of-the-art related work for finding probabilistic group Steiner trees in various cases.}

For a group \$\$V\_i\textbackslash in \textbackslash mathcal \{V\}\$\$, we say it is spanned by a tree if the tree contains at least one vertex of that group. The goal of the GPCST-SP problem is to find an r-rooted tree that minimizes the costs of the edges in the tree plus the penalty cost of the subcollection \$\$\textbackslash mathcal \{S\}\$\$containing these groups not spanned by the tree.

  abstract = {The research on statistical inference after data-driven model selection can be traced as far back as Koopmans (1949). The intensive research on modern model selection methods for high-dimensional data over the past three decades revived the interest in statistical inference after model selection. In recent years, there has been a surge of articles on statistical inference after model selection and now a rather vast literature exists on this topic. Our manuscript aims at presenting a holistic review of post-model-selection inference in linear regression models, while also incorporating perspectives from high-dimensional inference in these models. We first give a simulated example motivating the necessity for valid statistical inference after model selection. We then provide theoretical insights explaining the phenomena observed in the example. This is done through a literature survey on the post-selection sampling distribution of regression parameter estimators and properties of coverage probabilities of na¨ıve confidence intervals. Categorized according to two types of estimation targets, namely the population- and projection-based regression coefficients, we present a review of recent uncertainty assessment methods. We also discuss possible pros and cons for the confidence intervals constructed by different methods.},

  abstract = {Due to the ability of deep neural nets to learn rich representations, recent advances in unsupervised domain adaptation have focused on learning domain-invariant features that achieve a small error on the source domain. The hope is that the learnt representation, together with the hypothesis learnt from the source domain, can generalize to the target domain. In this paper, we first construct a simple counterexample showing that, contrary to common belief, the above conditions are not sufficient to guarantee successful domain adaptation. In particular, the counterexample exhibits conditional shift: the class-conditional distributions of input features change between source and target domains. To give a sufficient condition for domain adaptation, we propose a natural and interpretable generalization upper bound that explicitly takes into account the aforementioned shift. Moreover, we shed new light on the problem by proving an information-theoretic lower bound on the joint error of any domain adaptation method that attempts to learn invariant representations. Our result characterizes a fundamental tradeoff between learning invariant representations and achieving small joint error on both domains when the marginal label distributions differ from source to target. Finally, we conduct experiments on real-world datasets that corroborate our theoretical findings. We believe these insights are helpful in guiding the future design of domain adaptation and representation learning algorithms.},

  abstract = {Differences in moisture and protein content impact both nutritional value and processing efficiency of corn kernels. Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy can be used to estimate kernel composition, but models trained on a few environments may underestimate error rates and bias. We assembled corn samples from diverse international environments and used NIR with chemometrics and partial least squares regression (PLSR) to determine moisture and protein. The potential of five feature selection methods to improve prediction accuracy was assessed by extracting sensitive wavelengths. Gradient boosting machines (GBMs), particularly CatBoost and LightGBM, were found to effectively select crucial wavelengths for moisture (1409, 1900, 1908, 1932, 1953, 2174~nm) and protein (887, 1212, 1705, 1891, 2097, 2456~nm). SHAP plots highlighted significant wavelength contributions to model prediction. These results illustrate GBMs' effectiveness in feature engineering for agricultural and food sector applications, including developing multi-country global calibration models for moisture and protein in corn kernels.},

This problem aims to design a set of trips for the fleet of vehicles supplied by different depots for minimizing total traveling time. It addresses some realistic considerations, such as the customers’ time windows and the release date of customers’ packages. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer programming model. A hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm and a hybrid genetic algorithm are developed to solve this problem. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model and the efficiency of the proposed solution methods. The experimental results show that our proposed algorithms can obtain near-optimal solutions for small-scale problem instances, and solve some large-scale instances with up to 200 customers, 20 depots and 40 vehicles in reasonable computation time.},

  abstract = {Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy has been widely utilized to predict multi-constituents of corn in agriculture. However, directly extracting constituent information from the NIR spectra is challenging due to many issues such as broad absorption band, overlapping and non-specific nature. To solve these problems and extract implicit features from the raw data of NIR spectra to improve performance of quantitative models, a one-dimensional shallow convolutional neural network (CNN) model based on an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) feature extraction method was proposed in this paper. The leaf node feature information in the XGBoost was encoded and reconstructed to obtain the implicit features of raw data in the NIR spectra. A two-parametric Swish (TSwish or TS) activation function was proposed to improve the performance of CNN, and the elastic net (EN) was also applied to avoid the overfitting problem of the CNN model. Performance of the developed XGBoost-CNN-TS-EN model was evaluated using two public NIR spectroscopy datasets of corn and soil, and the obtained determination coefficients (R2) for moisture, oil, protein, and starch of the corn on test set were 0.993, 0.991, 0.998, and 0.992, respectively, with that of the soil organic matter being 0.992. The XGBoost-CNN-TS-EN model exhibits superior stability, good prediction accuracy, and generalization ability, demonstrating its great potentials for quantitative analysis of multi-constituents in spectroscopic applications.},

The elastic net is particularly useful when the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of observations (n). By contrast, the lasso is not a very satisfactory variable selection method in the p n case. An algorithm called LARS-EN is proposed for computing elastic net regularization paths efficiently, much like algorithm LARS does for the lasso.},
